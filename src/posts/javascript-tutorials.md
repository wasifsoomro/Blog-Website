## 1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language mainly used to add interactivity to websites. Along with HTML and CSS, it is a core technology for web development, enabling features like animated graphics, interactive forms, and real-time updates. JavaScript runs in the browser, making it an essential tool for frontend developers.

## 2. Setting Up JavaScript

To get started with JavaScript, open your browser's Developer Tools (usually accessible with `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) and go to the **Console** tab. Here, you can type JavaScript code and see the results instantly.

---

## 3. Basic Syntax

JavaScript syntax is easy to understand. Here’s a simple example:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
---
## 4. Variables and Data Types
Variables store information. In JavaScript, we use keywords like let, const, and var to declare variables. JavaScript has different data types: numbers, strings, booleans, etc.

Example:
```javascript
let name = "Alice";   // String
let age = 25;         // Number
let isStudent = true; // Boolean
```
--- 
## 5. Operators
Operators allow us to perform operations on variables and values. Here are a few basic ones:

Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=
Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, >, <

Example:
```javascript
let sum = 5 + 3;        // 8
let isEqual = (5 === 5); // true
```
--- 

## 6. Conditionals
Conditionals allow us to run different code based on certain conditions using if, else if, and else statements.

Example:
```javascript
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
    console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```
---

## 7. Loops
Loops are used to repeat code. Common types include for and while loops.

Example:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Number:", i);
}
```

---

## 8. Functions
Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. You define a function with the function keyword.

Example:
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

console.log(greet("Alice"));
```
Functions make code reusable and help organize larger programs.

---

## 9. Objects and Arrays
### Objects

Objects are collections of related data and functions. They use key-value pairs.

Example:
```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    }
};

person.greet(); // "Hello, Alice"
```

---

### Arrays
Arrays are lists that store multiple values in a single variable.

Example:
```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // "apple"
```
---

## 10. Conclusion
Congratulations on completing this quick tour of JavaScript basics! Practice each of these baby steps, and soon you’ll have a strong foundation in JavaScript.

Happy Coding!
